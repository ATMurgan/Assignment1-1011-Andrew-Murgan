Hey sir I'm leaving this note here because part of the assignment requirement is to have multiple commits over a period of time.
I'm mentioning this again like during the midterm exam but for some reason Intellij won't let me send commits to Github.
We tried fixing it in class and I spent more time after trying to resolve it but it still wouldn't work.
